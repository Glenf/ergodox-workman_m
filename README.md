# Workman layout for ErgoDox EZ

This layout moves toward [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) more and more.

Home row contains modifiers for control (A), option (S), command (H), and shift (T). 
These modifiers are inversed on the other half: shift (N), command (E), option (O), control (I).

Navigation layer follows VI-style navigation, with Workman mappings. N (left), O (down), U (up), I (right). 
Navigation has special mapping for my Alfred.app on I (shift + command + v) as paste from history.
